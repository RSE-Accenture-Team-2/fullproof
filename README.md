The best chrome browser extension for image verification! It utilises the Google Reverse Image Search Engine</b> 
and ELA analysis to help determine authentic images.

## Version 1.0.0
Currently this version of SerpAPI provides contextual information around an image based on SerpAPI,</b > 
a Google Reverse Image Search Engine Scraper:

    - No. of Search Results
    - Top 4 Google Image Reverse Search Links
    - Top 4 Related Search Keywords
    - Related Search Term

Our ELA Analysis of images has not yet been implemented on the backend, but there are scripts which were made</b>
which utilises the python PIL library which outputs an ELA image with a pixel extrema difference on a local machine.</b >

The SADs are available to see what was proposed as further possible features for this chrome extension.</b >
Some of the SAD's also represent the old tech stacks we initially proposed but had difficulty completing.</b >

This chrome extension could be further developed in the future, but as of now, it is an inactive project, after</b >
the completion of the Real Skills Education: Steam Leaders Program.

TMost of the features are also currently inactive as it costs money to maintain the extension's link with SerpAPI.</b >

Enjoy exploring!
